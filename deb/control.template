Description: Simple network simulator to test ping and traceroute implementations
 What happens if a traceroute with the same TTL/hop limit is received from two different source addresses? How will they react?
 crazytrace is a network simulation program that can be used to see how different ping and traceroute implementations react when the sender address is different than expected.
