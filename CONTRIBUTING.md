# Contributing

## Contribute feedback

I am happy to receive any form of friendly feedback. You can use the issue tracker.

## Report bugs

Unfortunately, it can always happen that a program does not behave as desired. In such cases I am happy to receive bug reports via the issue tracker. If you create a bug report please state the following:
- Version used
- Configuration file
- Environment (e.g. operating system)
- Output of the program at log level `trace`

If you do not know how to create this information, please create an issue anyway! I will then help you further.

## Express wishes

You miss a functionality of crazytrace? Feel free to express your wishes via the issue tracker. However, it is possible that I will not implement or reject these requests.

## Improve code

Have you found a place in the code that you would like to improve? Or you want to implement your wish yourself? No problem, just submit a pull request.

The following would be nice:
- Add a test for the new code
- No new errors or warnings from compiler or linter
- Formatted code

If you don't know how to do this or something similar, feel free to make the pull request anyway. I will then help you further.

I reserve the right to reject pull requests.

## Platforms

crazytrace can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mark22k/crazytrace) and [NotABug.org](https://notabug.org/mark22k/crazytrace). You are welcome to submit your issues or pull requests on both platforms.
